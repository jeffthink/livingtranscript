#Living Transcript

The living transcript is **accomplishment tracking for human beings**.

We all know the pain of maintaining multiple doc/pdf resumes, and many also know the pain of trying to find the human element amongst a collage of buzz words.  With a focus on quick "as you go" accomplishment entries, recommendations from friends and colleagues, and entry tags that connect people and accomplishments together, the living transcript is an attempt to replace the resume with not only a better technology solution, but also a better human-focused process solution.

This is a pretty standard rails app, so outside of some config tweaking, should be able to get up and running the traditional rails way.

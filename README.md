# Living Transcript

The Living Transcript tool was created as a way to create a more humane job posting and resume creation process. The origination was that resumes kind of suck - they don't do a great job at expressing things beyond job responsibilities (e.g. artistic expressions, how well your teammates enjoyed working with you, etc.), and employers find them too buzz-wordy to rely on for hiring. By separating accomplishments vs. competencies, and introducing "vouchers" for social validation, we hoped to force some rethinking of this process.

We build a simplified version of this for Tulane in 2011, and although it was a successful pilot project, all parties involved decided to move onto other projects afterwards. Since that point, platforms like LinkedIn and tools like [EnchanceCV](https://enhancv.com/) have improved the experience a bit, but by and large, this problem still exists so I hope someone else out there is inspired by this (not very defunct) repository :)

# Living Transcript

The Living Transcript tool was created as a way to create a more humane job posting and resume creation process. The origination was that resumes kind of suck - they don't do a great job at expressing things beyond job responsibilities (e.g. artistic expressions, how well your teammates enjoyed working with you, etc.), and employers find them too buzz-wordy to rely on for hiring. By separating accomplishments vs. competencies, and introducing "vouchers" for social validation, we hoped to force some rethinking of this process. By calling it "Living Transcript", we wanted to put emphasis on the continual growth we do personally & professionally, and that our job applying / hiring tools & processes should reflect that.

We build a simplified version of this for Tulane in 2011, and although it was a successful pilot project, all parties involved decided to move onto other projects afterwards. Since that point, platforms like LinkedIn and tools like [EnchanceCV](https://enhancv.com/) have improved the experience a bit, but by and large, this problem still exists so I hope someone else out there is inspired by this (very defunct) repository :)

Here are some wireframes that we were building towards:
